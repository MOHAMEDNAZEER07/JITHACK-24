# Farmer's Delight - Empowering Farmers with Technology

**Farmer's Delight** is a comprehensive web platform designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions for their agricultural endeavors. By leveraging machine learning, real-time data, and expert knowledge, the platform provides three core features: crop recommendations, vegetable price prediction, and a plant care assistant. This innovative solution aims to improve farm productivity, optimize market prices, and provide quick plant care guidance, all tailored to the needs of modern farmers.

## Key Features

### üåæ **Crop Recommendation System**
- Utilizes a **Random Forest regression model** to recommend suitable crops based on environmental factors such as temperature, season, and disaster occurrences.
- The model analyzes historical data to suggest the most profitable crops, enabling farmers to plan their crops better and increase yields.

### üí∞ **Vegetable Price Prediction**
- Predicts the prices of various vegetables based on features like season, month, temperature, and past market data.
- Helps farmers make informed decisions about when to harvest and sell crops to maximize profitability and reduce losses.

### üå± **Plant Doctor**
- A plant care assistant where farmers can submit queries regarding plant diseases, symptoms, and care.
- Provides expert guidance through an AI-powered system based on pre-trained models, helping farmers address plant health issues promptly.

### üñ•Ô∏è **User-Friendly Interface**
- The platform is designed to be intuitive and accessible for farmers with minimal technical knowledge, featuring an easy-to-navigate interface powered by **Bootstrap 5.3.2**.
- Real-time predictions and crop recommendations are just a few clicks away, making it easy for farmers to use the platform in their daily routines.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - **Django 5.0.6**: A robust and scalable web framework that powers the server-side logic and business rules of the platform.
  - **Django-Heroku**: For seamless deployment to **Heroku**, ensuring scalability and high availability in the cloud.
  - **Scikit-learn**: Implements machine learning algorithms for vegetable price prediction and crop recommendation.
  - **Joblib**: Efficiently handles the saving and loading of machine learning models.
  - **Gunicorn**: A WSGI server used for serving the Django application in production environments.

- **Frontend:**
  - **HTML** and **CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the platform‚Äôs web pages.
  - **Bootstrap 5.3.2**: Provides a responsive and mobile-friendly design.
  - **JavaScript**: Handles user interactions, such as form validation and button actions.

- **Database:**
  - **PostgreSQL**: Stores essential data such as vegetable prices, crop recommendations, and user queries.
  - **Psycopg2**: Allows Python to interface with the PostgreSQL database.

- **Cloud Deployment:**
  - **Heroku**: Hosted on Heroku for fast deployment and scalable cloud infrastructure.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites:
